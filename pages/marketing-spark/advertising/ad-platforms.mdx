## How Platforms Work Together

Smart advertisers use multiple platforms that complement each other:

```
Someone sees Paws & Claws Reel on Instagram
           ↓
They search "Paws & Claws pet shop" on Google
           ↓
They see a Google ad and click to website
           ↓
They see retargeting ad on Facebook later
           ↓
They finally visit the store!
```

This is called a **multi-touch attribution** - multiple ads contributed to one customer.
