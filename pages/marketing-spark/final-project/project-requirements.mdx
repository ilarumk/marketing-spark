## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<div className="important-box">
  <strong>Watch Out For:</strong>

  - **Generic content** that could work for any business
  - **Unrealistic goals** (gaining 10,000 followers in a month)
  - **Missing elements** from the requirements
  - **Inconsistent voice** across content pieces
  - **No connection** between sections (personas should influence content!)
  - **Forgetting hashtags** or calls-to-action
</div>

## Tips for Success

### Do This
- Reference the Paws & Claws context materials
- Make everything specific to the pet shop industry
- Connect your sections (persona → content → campaign)
- Be realistic about what a small business can do
- Show your personality in the content

### Don't Do This
- Copy generic marketing templates
- Include strategies that don't fit a local pet shop
- Skip the details (specificity shows understanding)
- Forget about budget constraints
- Create content you wouldn't want to see yourself
