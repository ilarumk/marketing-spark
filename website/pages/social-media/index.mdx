# Platform Overview

<span className="badge badge-beginner">Beginner</span>

Not all social media platforms are the same. Each one has different users, content styles, and best practices. Let's explore the major platforms and how businesses use them.

## The Big Picture

Each platform has its own:
- **Audience** - Who uses it most
- **Content style** - What works best there
- **Algorithm** - How it decides what to show people
- **Vibe** - The culture and expectations

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>Key Insight:</strong> You don't need to be on EVERY platform. Smart marketers pick the platforms where their audience actually hangs out.

## Which Platform for Paws & Claws?

Let's think about our practice business. Paws & Claws Pet Shop would probably focus on:

1. **Instagram** - Perfect for cute pet photos and reels
2. **TikTok** - Great for funny pet videos and tips
3. **Facebook** - Good for local community and events (like adoption days)

They might skip Pinterest (not the right audience) and Twitter (too fast-paced for a local shop).
