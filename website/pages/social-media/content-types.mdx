## The Main Content Formats

A series of images you swipe through. Great for Instagram.

**Best for:**

- Lists (swipe for each item)

**Tips:**
- First image needs to grab attention
- Make people want to swipe
- Last slide should have a call-to-action

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Carousels often get more engagement than single images because people spend more time swiping through them.

### 8. User-Generated Content (UGC)

Content created by your customers or fans that you share.

**Best for:**
- Social proof (showing real customers)
- Building community
- Getting content without creating it yourself
- Testimonials

**Tips:**
- Always ask permission before reposting
- Give credit to the original creator

  <strong>Why UGC Works:</strong> People trust other customers more than they trust brands. A real customer photo is often more convincing than a professional ad!
