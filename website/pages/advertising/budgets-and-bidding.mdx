# Budgets & How Ads Get Shown

<span className="badge badge-intermediate">Intermediate</span>

Understanding how ad budgets work helps you plan campaigns and understand why some ads show more than others. Let's explore the economics of digital advertising.

## How Much Do Ads Cost?

The honest answer: It depends!

Ad costs vary based on:
- What platform you're using
- Who you're trying to reach
- How many advertisers want to reach the same people
- How good your ad is
- What time of year it is

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>Good News:</strong> You can start advertising with just a few dollars. You don't need thousands to run your first ad campaign.
</div>

## Budget Basics

When setting up ads, you choose a budget:

### Daily Budget
"I'll spend up to $10 per day"
- Platform shows ads throughout the day
- Spending stops when budget is reached
- Resets the next day

### Lifetime Budget
"I'll spend $100 total over 10 days"
- Platform spreads budget across the campaign
- More flexibility in spending per day
- Good for campaigns with end dates

## How Payment Works

There are different ways you can pay for ads:

### CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand)
- You pay for every 1,000 times your ad is shown
- Good for: Awareness campaigns
- Example: $5 CPM means $5 for 1,000 impressions

### CPC (Cost Per Click)
- You only pay when someone clicks your ad
- Good for: Traffic campaigns
- Example: $0.50 CPC means $0.50 per click

### CPV (Cost Per View)
- You pay when someone watches your video ad
- Good for: Video campaigns
- Example: $0.02 per view

## The Auction System

Here's something most people don't know: **ads work like an auction**.

When there's a spot to show an ad, multiple advertisers are competing for it. But it's not just about who pays the most.

### What Determines Who Wins?

1. **Bid Amount** - How much you're willing to pay
2. **Ad Quality** - How relevant and engaging your ad is
3. **Expected Action Rate** - How likely people are to engage

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>The Twist:</strong> A better ad can beat a higher bid! If your ad is more relevant, you might pay less and still win the auction. This rewards good advertisers.
</div>

## What Is a DSP?

You might hear the term **DSP** (Demand-Side Platform).

### Simple Explanation

A DSP is like a shopping system for ads. Instead of going to each website individually to buy ads, advertisers use a DSP to:

- Buy ad space across many websites at once
- Automate the buying process
- Target specific audiences
- Optimize campaigns automatically

### Why It Matters

Big companies use DSPs to:
- Buy millions of ad impressions efficiently
- Target people across the entire internet
- Use data to find the best audiences

For small businesses (like Paws & Claws), the ad platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads) handle this automatically. You don't need to worry about DSPs directly!

## Budget Planning: A Real Example

Let's plan a budget for Paws & Claws:

### Scenario: Adoption Day Event

**Goal:** Get 100 people to the event
**Timeline:** 2 weeks before the event

### Estimating Costs

1. **Awareness ads** (get people to know about it)
   - Budget: $50
   - Expected CPM: $8
   - Estimated impressions: 6,250

2. **Traffic ads** (get people to event page)
   - Budget: $50
   - Expected CPC: $0.50
   - Estimated clicks: 100

3. **Total budget:** $100
4. **Expected outcome:** 6,250 people see the ad, 100 click to learn more

### Is It Worth It?

If 100 clicks lead to 20 event attendees, and 5 people adopt pets ($150 adoption fee each):
- Revenue: $750
- Ad spend: $100
- Return: 7.5x

That's a great return!

## Budget Tips

### Start Small
- Begin with $5-10/day
- Test what works
- Scale up what performs well

### Set Clear Goals
- What are you trying to achieve?
- How much is that worth to you?
- Work backward from the value

### Monitor and Adjust
- Check performance daily at first
- Pause ads that aren't working
- Put more budget into winners

### Account for Seasons
- Holidays = more competition = higher costs
- Plan bigger budgets for peak times
- Less competition = cheaper ads

<div className="important-box">
  <strong>Never Set and Forget:</strong> Ads need monitoring. Don't just turn them on and walk away. Check regularly and adjust based on performance.

## Understanding Ad Metrics

When running ads, you'll see these metrics:

| Metric | What It Means | Good Benchmark |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| CPM | Cost per 1,000 impressions | $5-15 |
| CPC | Cost per click | $0.30-2.00 |
| CTR | Click-through rate | 1-3% |
| Frequency | Average times each person saw ad | 2-3 ideal |

### Reading the Numbers

**High CPM + Low CTR** = Ad isn't resonating, try new creative

**High CTR + High CPC** = Competitive audience, might need to adjust targeting

**High Frequency** = Same people seeing it too many times, expand audience
