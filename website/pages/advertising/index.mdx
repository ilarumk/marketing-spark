# How Ads Work

<span className="badge badge-intermediate">Intermediate</span>

You've learned organic marketing (free content). Now let's explore paid advertising - how businesses pay to get their message in front of more people.

## Organic vs. Paid: What's the Difference?

### Organic (Free)
- You post content
- Algorithm decides who sees it
- Reach is limited and unpredictable
- Takes time to build audience

### Paid (Advertising)
- You pay to show content to people
- You choose who sees it
- Reach is predictable and scalable
- Can get results quickly

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>The Reality:</strong> Most successful businesses use BOTH. Organic builds community and trust. Paid amplifies reach and drives specific actions.
</div>

## Why Businesses Pay for Ads

### 1. Reach More People
Organic posts might reach 5-10% of followers. Ads can reach thousands of new people.

### 2. Target Specific Audiences
Show ads ONLY to people likely to care - like dog owners within 10 miles of your store.

### 3. Get Predictable Results
With ads, you can estimate how many people will see your content based on your budget.

### 4. Drive Specific Actions
Want people to visit your website? Sign up? Buy something? Ads can be optimized for these goals.

## How Do Ads Get Shown?

When you scroll through Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube, you see two types of content:

1. **Organic content** - Posts from accounts you follow or the algorithm thinks you'll like
2. **Ads** - Content that businesses paid to show you

### Ads Are Labeled

You can always tell if something is an ad:
- "Sponsored" label on Instagram/Facebook
- "Ad" label on YouTube
- "Promoted" on Twitter

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>Think About It:</strong> The next time you see an ad, ask yourself: "Why did this business want ME to see this? What do they know about me?" The answer is: quite a lot!
</div>

## The Basic Ad Process

Here's how it works when a business runs an ad:

### Step 1: Create the Ad
Design the image/video and write the copy (text).

### Step 2: Choose the Audience
Decide who should see it (age, location, interests, etc.).

### Step 3: Set a Budget
Decide how much to spend (per day or total).

### Step 4: Set a Goal
What do you want people to do? (See it, click it, buy something)

### Step 5: Launch
The ad starts showing to your chosen audience.

### Step 6: Monitor & Adjust
Check how it's performing and make changes if needed.

## What Makes a Good Ad?

Good ads share many qualities with good organic content:

| Element | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|
| Strong hook | Grabs attention in first seconds |
| Clear message | People understand what you're offering |
| Right audience | Shows to people who might actually care |
| Clear CTA | Tells people what to do next |
| Good visuals | Professional, eye-catching |

### The Difference

Ads need to work HARDER because:
- People know it's an ad (they're skeptical)
- You're interrupting what they were doing
- You have even less time to capture attention

<div className="important-box">
  <strong>The Golden Rule of Ads:</strong> The best ads don't feel like ads. They feel like helpful content that happens to mention a product or service.
</div>

## Ad Formats You See Every Day

### Instagram/Facebook

**Reel Ads** - Appear between Reels you're watching
**Carousel Ads** - Multiple images to swipe through

### YouTube

**Pre-roll** - Before your video starts (some skippable)
**Mid-roll** - In the middle of longer videos
**Display** - Sidebar and banner ads
**Shorts Ads** - Between YouTube Shorts

### TikTok

**In-Feed** - Between TikToks in your For You page

## Key Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Impression** | One time your ad was shown |
| **Click** | Someone clicked on your ad |
| **CTR** | Click-through rate (clicks ÷ impressions) |
| **CPC** | Cost per click |
| **CPM** | Cost per 1,000 impressions |
| **Conversion** | Someone took desired action |
| **ROAS** | Return on ad spend (revenue ÷ ad cost) |

## Is Paid Advertising Worth It?

For businesses, the question is: "Do we make more than we spend?"

**Example:**
- Pet shop spends $100 on ads
- Ads bring in 20 new customers
- Average customer spends $50
- Total revenue: $1,000
- Profit from ads: $900

That's a 10x return - definitely worth it!

But if the same $100 only brought 1 customer who spent $50, they'd lose $50. Not worth it.
