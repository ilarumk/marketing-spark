# Targeting: Reaching the Right People

<span className="badge badge-intermediate">Intermediate</span>

The real power of digital advertising isn't just reaching people - it's reaching the RIGHT people. This is called targeting.

## What Is Targeting?

Targeting means choosing exactly who sees your ad based on:
- Who they are (demographics)
- What they like (interests)
- What they do (behaviors)
- Where they are (location)

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Showing a cat food ad to dog owners wastes money. Showing it to cat owners within 10 miles of your store? That's smart targeting.
</div>

## How Do Platforms Know So Much?

You might wonder: "How does Instagram know I like dogs?"

Platforms collect data from:

| Source | What They Learn |
|--------|----------------|
| Profile info | Age, location, gender |
| What you follow | Interests |
| What you engage with | Likes and preferences |
| What you search | Intent and needs |
| What you buy | Shopping habits |
| Apps on your phone | Other interests |
| Websites you visit | Browsing behavior |

<div className="important-box">
  <strong>Privacy Note:</strong> This is why privacy settings matter! Be aware of what data you share online. Companies use this information for advertising.

## Types of Targeting

### 1. Demographic Targeting

Target by who people ARE:
- **Age** - 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.
- **Gender** - Male, female, all
- **Location** - Country, state, city, zip code, or radius
- **Language** - What language they speak

**Example for Paws & Claws:**
"People aged 25-55 within 15 miles of our store"

### 2. Interest Targeting

Target by what people LIKE:
- Pet owners
- Dog lovers
- Cat enthusiasts
- Organic/natural products
- Local shopping

**Example for Paws & Claws:**
"People interested in dogs, pet care, and pet adoption"

### 3. Behavioral Targeting

Target by what people DO:
- Recently moved (might need pet supplies)
- Engages with pet content
- Shops online frequently
- Clicks on local business ads

**Example for Paws & Claws:**
"People who have engaged with pet content in the last 30 days"

### 4. Custom Audiences

Target people you already know:
- Your email list
- People who visited your website
- People who engaged with your content
- Current customers

**Example for Paws & Claws:**
"People who visited our website but didn't make a purchase"

### 5. Lookalike Audiences

Find new people similar to your best customers:
- Platform finds people who "look like" your existing customers
- Based on similar demographics, interests, behaviors

**Example for Paws & Claws:**
"Find people similar to our top customers"

## Location Targeting Deep Dive

For local businesses like Paws & Claws, location is crucial.

### Options

**Radius targeting:** "Everyone within 10 miles of our store"

**Zip code targeting:** "Only these specific zip codes"

**City targeting:** "Everyone in [city name]"

### Why Location Matters

A pet shop in Ohio doesn't want to pay to show ads to people in California - they'll never visit the store!

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>Geo-Fencing:</strong> Some advanced targeting can show ads to people who are physically near your location RIGHT NOW. Imagine walking by a pet shop and getting an ad for 20% off!

### Online Shoe Store

## Narrowing vs. Broadening

### Too Narrow
"Women aged 32-33 who own exactly 2 cats and live on Maple Street"
- Not enough people to reach
- Ads won't show efficiently

### Too Broad
"Everyone in the United States"
- Wastes money on people who will never buy
- Low conversion rates

### Just Right
"Adults 25-55 within 15 miles interested in pets"
- Big enough to reach efficiently
- Focused enough to be relevant

---

## Targeting Strategy

### Step 1: Start with Your Customer
Who actually buys from this business?
- Demographics
- Location
- Interests

### Step 2: Think About Intent
Who is most likely to take action?
- Pet owners (not just people who like pet videos)
- People in your area (not across the country)
- People with buying behavior

### Step 3: Test and Learn
- Start with educated guesses
- See what performs best
- Adjust targeting based on results

## Retargeting: A Special Strategy

**Retargeting** shows ads to people who already showed interest.

### How It Works
1. Someone visits your website
2. A "pixel" (tiny tracking code) records this
3. Later, they see your ad on social media
4. "Hey, remember us? Come back!"

### Why It Works
- These people already know you
- They showed interest
- They're more likely to convert

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>You've Seen This:</strong> Ever looked at a product online, then seen ads for it everywhere? That's retargeting!
</div>
