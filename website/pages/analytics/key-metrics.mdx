# Key Metrics Explained

<span className="badge badge-beginner">Beginner</span>

Let's break down the most important metrics and understand what each one really tells you about your content's performance.

## The Big Three: Reach, Engagement, Conversions

Think of these as a funnel:

```
         REACH
     (How many saw it?)
            ↓
       ENGAGEMENT
    (Did they interact?)
            ↓
      CONVERSIONS
   (Did they take action?)
```

## Reach & Impressions

### Reach
The number of **unique people** who saw your content.

If 1,000 people saw your post, your reach is 1,000.

### Impressions
The **total number of times** your content was displayed.

If those 1,000 people saw your post twice on average, your impressions would be 2,000.

### Why Both Matter

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| High reach | You're getting in front of people |
| High impressions vs. reach | Same people seeing it multiple times |
| Low reach | Content isn't being distributed |

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>Good to Know:</strong> Impressions are always equal to or higher than reach. If they're much higher, people are seeing your content repeatedly.
</div>

## Engagement Metrics

Engagement shows if people cared enough to do something.

### Likes (Hearts)
- **What it means:** Basic approval
- **How valuable:** Low - easy to give
- **Good for:** Quick gauge of content reception

### Comments
- **What it means:** They took time to respond
- **How valuable:** High - real engagement
- **Good for:** Building community, getting feedback

### Shares/Reposts
- **What it means:** They wanted others to see it
- **How valuable:** Very high - extends your reach for free
- **Good for:** Growing audience organically

### Saves
- **What it means:** Content valuable enough to revisit
- **How valuable:** Very high - signals quality
- **Good for:** Understanding what people find useful

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>Save to Win:</strong> On Instagram, saves are weighted heavily by the algorithm. Content with lots of saves gets shown to more people.
</div>

## Engagement Rate

This is the percentage of people who engaged with your content.

### Basic Formula

```
Engagement Rate = (Total Engagements ÷ Reach) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 500 total engagements (likes + comments + shares + saves)
- 10,000 reach
- Engagement Rate = (500 ÷ 10,000) × 100 = 5%

### What's a Good Engagement Rate?

| Rate | Generally Means |
|------|----------------|
| 1-2% | Average |
| 3-5% | Good |
| 5%+ | Excellent |
| 10%+ | Exceptional (or small audience) |

Note: Smaller accounts often have higher rates because they have tighter communities.

## Follower Metrics

### Follower Growth

- **Followers gained:** New people who followed you
- **Followers lost:** People who unfollowed
- **Net change:** Gained - Lost

### Why People Unfollow

Don't panic about unfollows! People unfollow because:
- Content changed from what they expected
- They're cleaning up their feed
- They lost interest in the topic
- They were bots being cleaned up

<div className="important-box">
  <strong>Remember:</strong> 10 engaged followers are worth more than 1,000 who never interact. Don't obsess over the follower number.
</div>

## Video Metrics

For TikTok, Reels, YouTube:

### Views
How many times the video was watched.

### Watch Time
Total minutes people spent watching.

### Average Watch Duration
How long people watched on average.

### Completion Rate
What percentage watched to the end.

### Why Video Metrics Matter Differently

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| High views, low completion | Hook works, but video loses them |
| Low views, high completion | Content is good, but not being discovered |
| High average watch time | Content is engaging |

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>The 3-Second Rule:</strong> If people leave in the first 3 seconds, your hook isn't working. If they leave in the middle, your content needs work.
</div>

---

## Conversion Metrics

Conversions measure if people took the action you wanted.

### Examples of Conversions
- Clicked a link
- Visited a website
- Made a purchase
- Signed up for email
- Attended an event

### Click-Through Rate (CTR)

```
CTR = (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 50 link clicks
- 2,000 impressions
- CTR = (50 ÷ 2,000) × 100 = 2.5%

### What's a Good CTR?

For organic social media: 1-3% is good
For ads: Depends on platform and industry

## Story Metrics

Stories have unique metrics:

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| Views | How many saw the story |
| Exits | People who left without finishing |
| Next story taps | Moved forward quickly |
| Back taps | Wanted to see again (good!) |
| Replies | Engaged enough to respond |
| Link clicks | Took action |

### Reading Story Metrics

- **High exits** = Story isn't interesting
- **High back taps** = Content worth rewatching
- **High next taps** = People moving through quickly (could be good or bad)

## Metrics for Paws & Claws

What should they prioritize?

### Primary Goals
1. **Local awareness** - Reach in their area
2. **Community building** - Comments and saves
3. **Store visits** - Link clicks to directions

### Key Metrics to Track
| Goal | Metrics |
|------|--------|
| Awareness | Reach, follower growth |
| Engagement | Comments, saves, shares |
| Store visits | Link clicks, "Get Directions" clicks |
| Event turnout | Event responses, attendance |

## Common Mistakes with Metrics

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| Only looking at likes | Likes are the least meaningful engagement |
| Checking too often | Creates anxiety, not insights |
| Comparing to huge accounts | Different playing field |
| Ignoring saves | One of the most valuable metrics |
| Not tracking over time | One post doesn't show the pattern |

---

## Activity: Calculate Engagement Rate

<div className="activity-box">
  <strong>Practice Problem:</strong>

  A Paws & Claws post got:
  - 120 likes
  - 15 comments
  - 5 shares
  - 25 saves
  - Reach: 2,500

  **Calculate:**

  1. Total engagements: _______________

  2. Engagement rate (total ÷ reach × 100): _______________%

  3. Is this a good engagement rate? _______________

  ---

  **Answers:**
  1. 120 + 15 + 5 + 25 = 165
  2. (165 ÷ 2,500) × 100 = 6.6%
  3. Yes! 6.6% is above average (3-5% is considered good)
</div>
