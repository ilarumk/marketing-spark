## What Is an Analytics Report?

An analytics report is a summary of your performance over a period of time. It shows:
- How your content performed
- How your audience is growing
- What's working and what's not

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>Don't Panic:</strong> You don't need to understand every number. Focus on the key metrics that matter for your goals.

**Questions to Ask:**

## Identifying Top Performing Content

Look at your best posts and ask:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| What type of content was it? | Format matters (reel vs. photo, etc.) |
| What topic was it about? | Topic interests vary |
| When was it posted? | Timing affects performance |
| What was the caption like? | Writing style impacts engagement |
| Did it have a strong hook? | First impression matters |

### Pattern Recognition

If your top 3 posts this month were all:
- Reels
- About pet care tips
- Posted on Tuesday evening

...then you should probably make more Reels about pet care tips and post them on Tuesday evenings!

## Creating a Simple Tracking System

You don't need fancy tools. A simple spreadsheet works:

```
| Date | Post Topic | Type | Reach | Likes | Comments | Saves | Eng. Rate |
|------|------------|------|-------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1/10 | Dog food tips | Carousel | 1,200 | 85 | 12 | 45 | 11.8% |
| 1/12 | Funny cat reel | Reel | 2,500 | 180 | 25 | 30 | 9.4% |
| 1/14 | New product | Photo | 800 | 40 | 5 | 8 | 6.6% |
```

Track for a month and patterns will emerge!

## Comparing Time Periods

Always compare to something:
- This week vs. last week
- This month vs. last month
- This quarter vs. last quarter

### What to Look For

**Growth Trends:**
- Are numbers going up, down, or flat?
- Is growth accelerating or slowing?

**Anomalies:**
- Any spikes? What caused them?
- Any dips? What happened?

**Patterns:**
- Certain days perform better?
- Certain content types win?

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> One viral post can skew your averages. Look at multiple posts over time to see true patterns.
