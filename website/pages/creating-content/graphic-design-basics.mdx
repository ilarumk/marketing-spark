## The 5 Basic Design Principles

### 1. Contrast

Make important things stand out by using differences in:
- Color (dark vs. light)
- Size (big vs. small)
- Weight (bold vs. thin)

**Example:** A bold white title on a dark background is easy to read.

### 2. Alignment

Line things up! It makes designs look clean and organized.
- Don't randomly place elements
- Use guides and grids
- Keep text aligned (left, center, or right - pick one)

### 3. Repetition

Use consistent elements throughout your brand:
- Same colors
- Same fonts
- Same style of images
- Same logo placement

This builds recognition.

### 4. Proximity

Group related things together. Space unrelated things apart.
- Title and subtitle should be close
- Different sections should have clear separation

### 5. White Space

Empty space is your friend! It:
- Makes designs easier to read
- Feels more professional
- Draws attention to what matters

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Beginners often try to fill every inch of space. Resist this urge! The best designs "breathe" with plenty of white space.

## Color Basics

### The Color Wheel
Colors are organized in a wheel. Understanding it helps you choose colors that work together.

### Color Combinations That Work

| Type | What It Means | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Complementary | Opposite on wheel | Blue + Orange |
| Analogous | Next to each other | Blue + Purple + Pink |
| Monochromatic | Shades of one color | Light blue to dark blue |

### Choosing Brand Colors

Pick 2-4 colors for your brand:
- **Primary color** - Main brand color
- **Secondary color** - Accent color
- **Neutral colors** - Black, white, gray for text/backgrounds

### For Paws & Claws
- Primary: Warm orange (friendly, energetic)
- Secondary: Teal (trustworthy, calm)
- Neutrals: White, dark gray

### Color Psychology

Colors create feelings:

| Color | Feeling |
|-------|---------|
| Red | Energy, urgency, passion |
| Orange | Friendly, cheerful, confident |
| Yellow | Happy, optimistic, warm |
| Green | Natural, healthy, peaceful |
| Blue | Trustworthy, calm, professional |
| Purple | Creative, luxurious, mysterious |
| Pink | Playful, feminine, gentle |

## Typography (Fonts)

### Font Pairing Rules

Use 2 fonts maximum:
1. **Header font** - Bold, attention-grabbing
2. **Body font** - Easy to read

### Font Categories

| Type | When to Use | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Serif | Traditional, trustworthy | Times, Georgia |
| Sans-serif | Modern, clean | Arial, Helvetica |
| Script | Elegant, creative | Brush scripts |
| Display | Headlines only | Decorative fonts |

### Typography Tips

- Make sure text is readable
- Use size to create hierarchy (bigger = more important)
- Don't use more than 2-3 font sizes
- Ensure enough contrast between text and background

<div className="important-box">
  <strong>Readability First:</strong> A fancy font means nothing if people can't read it. Always choose clarity over creativity.
</div>
