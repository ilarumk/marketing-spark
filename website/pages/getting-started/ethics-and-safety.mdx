<span className="badge badge-beginner">Beginner</span>

Before you start marketing online, you need to know how to do it responsibly. This lesson covers the rules and ethics that every good marketer follows.

## Why Ethics Matter in Marketing

Marketing is powerful - it influences what people think, feel, and buy. With that power comes responsibility.

<div className="important-box">
  <strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> Good marketers are honest. They don't trick, deceive, or manipulate people. Unethical marketing might work short-term, but it destroys trust and can even be illegal.
</div>

## The Rules Every Marketer Must Follow

### 1. Always Be Honest

**Do:**
- Tell the truth about products and services
- Only make claims you can back up
- Be clear about what something costs

**Don't:**
- Exaggerate or make things sound better than they are
- Hide important information (like fees or downsides)
- Create fake reviews or testimonials

### 2. Disclose Sponsored Content

If you're paid to promote something (or got it for free), you MUST tell your audience.

**Examples of proper disclosure:**
- "#ad" or "#sponsored" on social media posts
- "This video is sponsored by..." on YouTube
- "I received this product for free to review"

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>It's the Law!</strong> In the United States, the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) requires people to disclose when they're being paid to promote something. Not doing so can result in big fines!
</div>

### 3. Respect Privacy

- Never collect personal information without permission
- Don't spam people who didn't ask to hear from you
- Be careful with any data you have access to

### 4. Don't Target Vulnerable People

Ethical marketers don't take advantage of:
- People's insecurities
- Children (with manipulative tactics)
- People who might not understand what they're buying

### 5. Respect Copyright

- Only use images, music, and content you have permission to use
- Give credit when using someone else's work
- Don't copy other people's content and pretend it's yours

## Spotting Unethical Marketing

Learn to recognize bad practices so you don't copy them:

| Unethical Practice | What It Looks Like |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Clickbait** | "You WON'T BELIEVE what happened!" (and it's nothing special) |
| **Hidden Ads** | Sponsored content that looks like a regular post with no disclosure |
| **Fake Urgency** | "Only 2 left!" when there are actually plenty |
| **Fake Reviews** | Made-up testimonials or paid reviews that don't say they're paid |
| **Fear Tactics** | Making people scared so they'll buy something |
| **Misleading Claims** | "Lose 20 pounds in 1 day!" (impossible claims) |

If you're practicing marketing online, keep yourself safe:

### Protect Your Personal Information

- Be careful about sharing personal photos

### Be Careful with Accounts
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Don't share login information

### Get Permission
- If you're under 18, talk to a parent or guardian before creating business accounts
- Some platforms have age requirements (usually 13+)
- Get approval before posting anything representing a real business

### Watch Out for Scams
- Be suspicious of "get rich quick" marketing schemes

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>When in Doubt:</strong> Ask a trusted adult before doing anything online that feels uncertain or risky.

## Your Ethics Checklist

Before posting any marketing content, ask yourself:

- [ ] Is this completely honest?
- [ ] Have I disclosed if this is sponsored or paid?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable if everyone saw this?
- [ ] Am I respecting people's privacy?
- [ ] Am I using content I have permission to use?
- [ ] Would I be okay receiving this message myself?

If you can't check every box, revise your content.

## Activity: Spot the Problem

Look at these examples and identify what's wrong:

1. A influencer posts "OMG I love this face cream!" but was paid $5,000 to say it (with no disclosure)

2. A company shows a "customer photo" that's actually from a stock photo website

3. An ad says "93% of users saw results!" but the study only had 15 people in it

<div className="activity-box">
  <strong>Answers:</strong>
  1. Missing disclosure - should include #ad or #sponsored
  2. Fake testimonial - using stock photos as "real customers"
  3. Misleading statistics - sample size too small to be meaningful
</div>
