## Marketing in Simple Terms

**Marketing** is how businesses tell people about what they sell and why it's worth buying.

Think about it:
- When a YouTuber tells you about their new merch
- When you see a sponsored post on Instagram
- When a brand creates a funny TikTok video
- When you get an email about a sale

That's ALL marketing!
