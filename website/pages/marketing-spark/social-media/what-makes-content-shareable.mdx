# What Makes Content Shareable

<span className="badge badge-beginner">Beginner</span>

Why do some posts get thousands of shares while others get ignored? Let's break down the psychology of what makes content spread.

## Why People Share Content

Before creating content, understand WHY someone would share it. People share because:

1. **It's useful** - They want to help others
2. **It's entertaining** - They want others to laugh or smile
3. **It reflects their identity** - It says something about who they are
4. **It sparks conversation** - They want to discuss it
5. **It's emotionally moving** - It made them feel something strong

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>The Question:</strong> Before posting anything, ask: "Why would someone share this with their friends?"

## The 6 Elements of Shareable Content

### 1. Emotion

Content that triggers strong emotions gets shared more. This includes:

- **Joy** - Cute animals, feel-good stories, humor
- **Surprise** - Unexpected facts, plot twists
- **Awe** - Amazing accomplishments, beautiful things
- **Anger** - Injustice, things that feel unfair
- **Anxiety** - Important warnings, "you need to know this"

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>Science Says:</strong> Research shows that content triggering high-arousal emotions (excitement, awe, anger) gets shared much more than content triggering low-arousal emotions (sadness, calmness).
</div>

### 2. Practical Value

People share things that are genuinely useful:

- Life hacks and tips
- How-to guides
- Money-saving ideas
- Time-saving tricks
- Health and safety information

**Example:** "5 things you should never feed your dog" - pet owners share this to help other pet owners.

### 3. Stories

Humans are wired to remember and share stories:

- Personal experiences
- Customer success stories
- Behind-the-scenes narratives
- Origin stories

**Example:** "How a rescue dog from our shop became a therapy dog" - stories like this connect emotionally.

### 4. Social Currency

People share content that makes them look good:

- Makes them seem smart
- Makes them seem funny
- Makes them seem caring
- Makes them "in the know"

**Example:** Sharing a clever life hack makes someone feel helpful and knowledgeable.

### 5. Triggers

Content connected to everyday things gets reminded and shared:

- Day-of-week content ("Monday mood")
- Seasonal content ("First day of fall")
- Holiday content
- Current events

**Example:** Every time someone sees their pet being weird, they might think of that funny pet video they saw.

### 6. Public Visibility

When people see others engaging with content, they want to join in:

- Trends everyone is doing
- Viral challenges
- Popular sounds/formats
- Things "everyone is talking about"

## The Hook: First Impressions Matter

People decide in **1-3 seconds** whether to keep watching or scroll past. Your opening needs to grab attention.

### Strong Hooks:
- Ask a question: "Did you know...?"
- Make a bold statement: "This changed everything"
- Create curiosity: "Nobody talks about this"
- Show the payoff: "Here's the result" (then show how)
- Challenge beliefs: "You've been doing this wrong"

### Weak Hooks:
- "Hey guys, so today I'm going to..."
- Starting with logos or intros
- Slow buildup
- Anything that doesn't immediately interest the viewer

<div className="activity-box">
  <strong>Practice:</strong> Which hook is stronger?

  A) "Hi everyone, today I want to share some tips about pet care"

  B) "Your dog is trying to tell you something - here's what it means"

  **Answer:** B - it creates curiosity and promises value immediately.
</div>

## The Curiosity Gap

One powerful technique: **open a loop** that the viewer wants to close.

**How it works:**
1. Hint at something interesting
2. Don't reveal it right away
3. Make them watch/read to find out

**Examples:**
- "I made one change and my engagement doubled"
- "This is the biggest mistake new pet owners make"
- "Wait until you see what happens at the end"

Avoid these common mistakes:

| What Doesn't Work | Why |

| Constant sales posts | Feels like spam, no value |
| Low-quality images/video | Looks unprofessional |
| Copying trends too late | Feels outdated |
| No hook | People scroll past |
| Too complicated | Hard to understand quickly |

## Activity: Improve This Post

Here's a weak post for Paws & Claws:

> "We have dog food for sale. Come visit us!"

How could you make this more shareable?

<div className="activity-box">
