## What the Owner Wants

Maria's marketing wishlist:

1. **More foot traffic** - Especially on weekdays
2. **Grooming bookings** - Currently at 60% capacity
3. **Event attendance** - Want 50+ people at adoption days
4. **Social growth** - "I see other pet shops with 10k+ followers"
5. **Local awareness** - "People drive past us to go to PetMart"

<div className="important-box">
  <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The owners are willing to invest time and some money into marketing, but they need to see it's working. Quick wins + long-term strategy = best approach.
</div>
