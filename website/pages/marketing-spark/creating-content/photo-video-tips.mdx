## Photography Basics

### Lighting is Everything

The #1 factor in photo quality isn't your camera - it's lighting.

**Best lighting:**
- **Natural light** - Near windows, outdoors in shade
- **Golden hour** - Hour after sunrise or before sunset
- **Soft, diffused light** - Cloudy days are great!

**Avoid:**
- Direct harsh sunlight (creates shadows)
- Overhead fluorescent lights
- Mixing different light sources

<div className="tip-box">
  <strong>Quick Fix:</strong> Face your subject toward a window. The soft, natural light will make anything look better.
</div>

### The Rule of Thirds

Imagine your image divided into 9 equal squares (3x3 grid).

Place important elements:
- Along the lines
- At the intersections

This creates more interesting, professional compositions than centering everything.

**Turn it on:** Most phone cameras have a grid option in settings.

### Phone Photography Tips

1. **Clean your lens** - Seriously, it makes a huge difference
2. **Tap to focus** - Tap what you want sharp
3. **Hold steady** - Brace against something if needed
4. **Take multiple shots** - Choose the best one later
5. **Use portrait mode** - Great for products and pets
6. **Edit after** - Don't use heavy filters while shooting

## Video Basics

### Video is King

Video content gets:
- More engagement
- More shares
- More time on screen
- Better reach on most platforms

<div className="fun-fact">
  <strong>Stat:</strong> People spend 88% more time on websites with video. On social media, video gets 1200% more shares than text and images combined!
</div>

### Essential Video Tips

#### 1. Stability
Shaky video looks amateur. Solutions:
- Lean against a wall
- Use both hands
- Get a cheap phone tripod ($10-15)
- Rest your elbows on a table

#### 2. Horizontal vs. Vertical

| Orientation | Use For |
|-------------|---------|
| Vertical (9:16) | TikTok, Reels, Stories |
| Horizontal (16:9) | YouTube, websites |
| Square (1:1) | Instagram feed posts |

**Tip:** Most social media = vertical video

#### 3. Audio Matters

Bad audio ruins good video.
- Film in quiet spaces
- Get close to your subject
- Consider a cheap lavalier mic ($15-20)
- Use trending sounds/music when appropriate

#### 4. The First 3 Seconds

Grab attention immediately:
- Start with action, not intro
- Show the result first
- Ask a question
- Make a bold statement

**Don't start with:** "Hey guys, so today I'm going to..."

## Filming for Social Media

### Keep It Short

| Platform | Ideal Length |
|----------|-------------|
| TikTok | 15-60 seconds |
| Instagram Reel | 15-30 seconds |
| YouTube Short | 15-60 seconds |
| Stories | 15 seconds each |

### Captions Are Essential

80% of people watch video with sound OFF.

Always add:
- Text overlays for key points
- Captions for spoken words
- Visual hooks

**Tools for captions:**
- CapCut (free, excellent)
- Instagram's auto-captions
- TikTok's auto-captions

### B-Roll

B-roll is extra footage that adds visual interest.

**Example:** If you're talking about dog food:
- Main shot: You talking
- B-roll: Dogs eating, food pouring, happy pets

This keeps videos visually interesting.
